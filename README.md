# AI GOVSTACK - A Comprehensive Open Source AI Governance Stack

## Overview

The Open Source AI Management Stack is a comprehensive framework designed to manage AI projects efficiently and securely from the data level to the regulatory level. This framework ensures best practices are followed at every layer, integrating human expertise, regulatory compliance, and advanced AI techniques.

## Objectives

- **Codifying Best Practices:** Document and codify best practices for managing AI projects.
- **Human in the Loop:** Ensure EXPERT human oversight at critical points in the AI lifecycle.
- **Licensing & Regulation:** Implement licensing (or other suitable regulation) for AI agents and human experts to ensure compliance and accountability.
- **Innovation, Compliance & Speed:** Achieve rapid development and deployment of responsible and compliant AI solutions using pre-made templates that include regulatory requirements.

## Key Features
- Developed in collaboration with [OECD](https://oecd.ai/) and [GPAI](https://gpai.ai).
- Align with international AI standards and practices.

## Layer Explainations

1. **Regulation**
   - **Description:** Oversight and regulatory frameworks for AI deployment.
   - **Best Practices:** Establish supervisory roles, create clear guidelines and standards.
1. **Legislation**
   - **Description:** Compliance with laws and regulations governing AI.
   - **Best Practices:** Ensure data stewardship, adhere to relevant laws and regulations.
1. **Interface**
   - **Description:** Governs how the final information is exposed and interacts with users and other systems.
   - **Best Practices:** Ensure transparency, usability, accessability, and security in the interfaces used to expose AI outputs and interactions.
1. **Human (w/Supervisors)**
   - **Description:** Integration of human expertise in the AI workflow.
   - **Best Practices:** Maintain a list of experts, ensure human experts are involved in critical decisions.  Supervisors function as a "Mixture of Experts" dispatcher, directing tasks for human evaluation based on specified criteria (like subject domain, location, certification, price, response time, etc.
1. **Agent**
   - **Description:** AI agents that act based on model predictions.
   - **Best Practices:** Implement standard employment terms, define rights and responsibilities of AI agents.
1. **Model**
   - **Description:** Development, training, and deployment of AI models.
   - **Best Practices:** Use robust algorithms, validate and test models thoroughly.
1. **Compute**
   - **Description:** Computational resources required to process and analyze data.
   - **Best Practices:** Optimize resource usage, ensure scalability and reliability.
1. **Data**
   - **Description:** Collection, storage, and management of data.
   - **Best Practices:** Ensure data integrity, security, and privacy.

## Action Plan

1. **Open Source Laws/Regulations:** Develop and share open-source regulatory frameworks based on current legislative and regulatory requirement.
1. **Employment of AI Agents:** Establish a framework for AI agent employment, possibly including licensing and taxation.
1. **Human Experts:**  Establish a fremework to integrate human experts to handle AI oversight and review routed based on expertise criteria.
1. **Trust:** Build trust through transparency and rigorous testing.
